<h2>The Master Medical Equipment Promise:
If there is a product that does not pass our MME 5-Point Inspection process, it does not receive the MME Seal of Approval. We offer that guarantee because we want only the best for our customers.

Don’t be persuaded by the one-man popshops out there with used medical equipment who promise more than they can deliver. Our company stands by our guarantee and if we don’t have what you need, we can find it from a reputable dealer.

  Here at Master Medical Equipment, we value relationships and your business is important to us.</h2>
<h3>“MME is always helpful and on top of my orders! They really know the industry. Customer service is second to none and they make sure that what I need is what I get. Warranty has never been a problem.”

Doug Neel
  Repair Manager House of Supply Co., Memphis TN.</h3>
